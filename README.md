I am a second-year Computer Science with AI student at the [University of Southampton](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/) and the Director of Industry Relations at the [University of Southampton AI Society](https://linktr.ee/USAIS).

Alongside my studies, I am also a part-time Machine Learning Research Assistant at the [IT Innovation Center](http://www.it-innovation.soton.ac.uk/), where I am working on the [TriagED](http://www.it-innovation.soton.ac.uk/projects/triaged) project, funded by [The Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-projects/decision-support-algorithms-emergency-departments).

I have a strong interest in AI/ML advancements (with a particular focus on FinTech applications such as Algorithmic Trading and Sentiment Analysis) and Quantum Computing applications.
